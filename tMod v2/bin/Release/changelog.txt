Note: if you're wondering why tMod updated, it's because of v1.0.6.1 (stupid name)
People complained because they can't manage to copy it themselves, so I posted an update including it.

This version: v3.1.5
    New in this version:
    * Added crash preventions in ListenForClients (should stop most if not all crashes)
    * Updated the Mana limit.

    ====Previous versions====
    v3.1.4:
    * Fixed /me
    * Fixed /party
    * Fixed /reply
    * Fixed ServerPassword <-- my bad, sorry
    * Remove meaningless crap
    * Include Group_Edit.exe

    v3.1.3:
    * Scrapped v3.5 source code due to shittyness (I won't go into much detail, but the way I did it was shit)
    * Began re-writing v3.5 features
    * Added CanBuild group setting
    * ADDED IN-SERVER WORLD GENERATION WHEN WORLD IS NOT FOUND!
    * Meddled with some lua stuff to make it work better
    * Added easter egg (complaints can be emailed to an invalid email address)

    v3.1.2:
    * Fixed for v1.0.5
    * Added BlockTileSquare setting
NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE V3.5 UPDATE, THAT REQUIRES MORE TESTING, THIS WAS A QUICK UPDATE FOR V1.0.6 OF TERRARIA!

    v3.1.1:
    * Fixed various bugs
    * Added /stupidize and /butterfingers
          - Don't know what they are? Try them out on yourself with /stupidize {name} ;D
          - Thanks to Dinnerbone for the idea, years ago. Like really, he made something called GSBOS and was using it on a forum called script-o-matic... meh I won't go into that!

    v3.1:
    * Fixed BindPort, BindAddress
    * Added -config argument
    * Added Configure.bat
    * Introduced auto-installation

    v3.0.9:
    * Fixed about 8000 bugs and exceptions
    * No longer supporting SqlServerCe
    * Some other stuff, can't remember, LOL.

    v3.0.8:
    * Re-added password cryptography. Sorry, I removed it as a test. Please delete your database if any users have registered. Again, I'm sorry.

    v3.0.7:
    * SQLite support.
    * Fixed /drop /give etc
    * Fixed some group bugs, sorry
    * Added readme.txt
    * Messed with teleportation, appears to be working fine.

    v3.0.6:
    * Fixed various bugs regarding Groups.xml
    * Fixed exception when player doesn't have a group (I swear I fixed this before... it came back though... LOL)
    * Fixed the most common player-crash exploit
    * Started to work on a fix for a MAJOR exploit I found in Terraria. It's semi-fixed.
    Anyone with a brain can still do it, except AFAIK I'm the only one that's found it so far.
    * Fixed various teleportation bugs, some still exist.
    * Created this file!
    Note: Exploits are all TERRARIA exploits and not tMod, consider yourselves lucky I'm fixing them.

    v3.0.5:
    * Logs just started. May re-create old changelogs at some point.
