tMod v3, contrary to what the directories say.

Please, don't rip this off and claim it as your own! I'm releasing this code so you can contribute to the mod, not so you can steal it. That's all you have permission to use it for. However, you're welcome to read it and learn from it as long as you don't copy and paste it.

Sorry if some of it's a mess, I didn't clean it. A lot of it is from tMod v2. The directories say tMod v2 because it was tMod v2 until the merge... Meh, it's complicated. Not really but... whatever!
